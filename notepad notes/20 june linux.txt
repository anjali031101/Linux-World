ping goo.gl
ifconfig enp0s3(network card name)
ifconfig enp0s3 10.1.12345
16 versions of ip available
publically we use ipv4(4bytes) and ipv6(16 bytes)
dealing with  ipv4
to remove ip
ifconfig enp0s3 0
ping 8.8.8.8
any system that are isolated from network is most secure os in the world
docker gives a way to isolate
docker is a key behind security
if config enp0s3 ip
why not pinging 
bcz network not known

switch(works for only same network)
router(tells the route of different network)
how can we check whats our network name or identify
152.168.1.2 and 152.168.10.3 1 octet or 2 or3
class A 1 - 126
 class B 128-191etc(unwanted cocept)
its our choice

subnet mask is a way through which we tell our network name
ex 192.168.1.2 = 255.255.0.0
network name is decided bcz then only we can tell what should we use router or switch

ifconfig enp0s3 ip (192.168.1.2) netmask 255.0.0.0
ifconfig
each program who makes packets only makes when he knows the network (routing table)it is away to tell program that if network is known or not
ping 192.168.1.3
route -n(for checking routing table)
ping 10.1.2.3(network unreachable)
gateway(router work as gateway ..network se andr bhar jane ko help krta h)
ping ip(not my ip its ip of router)
 ex hotspot wifi etc ex of router
 route add -net 8.0.0.0 gw (ip of mobile phn)192.168.1.1(new added router) or rote add -net 8.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1
ctrl c
route -n
ctrl c
nslookup www.facebook.com(to find ip of facebook)
0.0.0.0(anywhere in the world)
route add -net 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1
route -n 

one public(chargeable) by telecom  ip can only connect with public ip

private to private(free)
local network can be accessed by private but internet is only by public ip
as there is range of private IPs when we want to access internet then private ip is blocked ..use public ip
hotspot is both gateway and DHCP server(dynamic ip) and given by us is manually
yum install dhclient
dhclient -v
kill -no jo bhi h
