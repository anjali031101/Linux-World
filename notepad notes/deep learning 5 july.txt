deep learning 5 july
feed forward
aroma(smell)

brain k andr jo input leta h in the form of electric signal is the cell called neuron

5 senses 5 input came and gone to brain
now its the duty of brain 
(label set by someone)supervised ---y --- green tea

   input layer (x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 ) 
  brain layer 1(hidden layer) inside it 5 neuron are present 
neuron collecting info by x1 respectively 
first neuron of first layer did learning  little bit and then to learn in detail it forward to the next layer
each neuron of first layer after completing their learning the collective learning of all three is passed to the each neuron of next layer
the neuron of scnd layer analysed separately  in percent  
every neuron gives their input to y then y decides which neuron pattern is best in accuracy to identify
the way of third neuron to analyze is best giving perfect ans

we will only keep the neuron which gives best ans rest will be removed

input layer hidden layer 1 ...2 ..3..output layer
y is green tea the pattern we are learning  is for green tea
eye touch nose (hot aroma ) all gave contributions
jitne neuron h utne hi function honge system pr jyada load hoga
more neurons more accuracy
more neurons less performance
y will tell ans 
if more neuron than u can try more hit and trial method to find more accuracy
if u have x1 x2 x3 ...n dimensions data we will have

relu is optimized for intermediate func
brain works:
its the duty of neuron to find   weightage.that is eye is giving right info how much trust should neuron do etc
every info 
all inputs are given to each neuron in first laye
