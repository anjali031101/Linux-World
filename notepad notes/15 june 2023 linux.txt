one software depends on other software(dependency challenge and issues thats why rpm is not recommended to install)
dependency prblm can be solved thru yum or dnf command for installation

yum install httpd(automatic install new version no need to give )
min requirement of yum is it should no where the software located so we need to provide once location that is known as configure ..set up once

repository / rpm/repo :
vim vimal.repo(filename.repo)
go up to parent folder by
cd..
give url or location 
give unique name to url like [dvd1]

once configured then we can use yum anywhere we can remove install

yum will only install the software present in repository

epel release rhel9 yum repository(it will automatically configure the yum for u)
yum install vlc
