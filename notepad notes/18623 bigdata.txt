hardware is not reliable
ip1 issue of durability 
thru replication factor  replica we can achieve durability and availability(spfi) failure issue
master node and data node are different IP
hadoop fs -is(hadoop connected or not we dont know)
ping ip
yum install wget-y
after format new created master node

client decide copyimg of block 3 rep factor are decided by client it can only change
parallel opearation rpm -q jdk
jps(java k thru kitne process h)

and can tell which node
yum install vim -y
block size decided by client

task:
find out min size of block a
research
tcpdump(entire visibility for wire ne4)
yum install tcpdumps
ssh port no.
tcpdump   -i eth0 icmp -n
pimg work ok icmp protocol
task
find  out who sends the data to datanode whether it is master
how client come to know about whta is ip [by -
whether client send the data to all the data node or it send to one nodeand ask to data node to send other data 
nodes
what if client is sending data to  data node and that  data nodegoes down what will happen whether the operation of copy stops or not
check whether data is copying paarallely or the data is copying serially
master node will decide on which data node data stores
