in deep learning we say weight to coeff ..neuron tell the weight
 activation function changes in neuron acc to problem statement that is  linear reg. or binary classification .(sigmoid fun)
x y dono ko use krke learning shuru kr deta h
neuron have activation function
1 neuron equal to 1 activation fun
ml goal is to find bias and coeff.
coeff/weight/kernel
bias/constant
x and y knowing we find bias and coeff in deep learning
learning is done thru error and failure
one layer known as perceptron
in ml we use sklearn which use numpy if u have knowledge of numpy then u can do things without using sklearn

in deep learning we use tensorflow instead of numpy .the library instead of sklearn we use keras so that our work simplify (mathematical cal and algo are done by tensor flow)
