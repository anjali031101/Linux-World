# Step 1: Collect and preprocess data

# Step 2: Feature selection

# Step 3: Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Model training
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 6: Model tuning (optional)

# Step 7: Model deployment (save the model)
