#burthforce method
ml slope goes downward
computer does not understand graph visualization
error or loss zero so found c value in y=cx linear regression uses hit and trial for finding value of c
error showa the right direction if it is decreasing then we are in right direction
decreasing slope (relation b/w c(hor.) and error or loss(ver.) thru graph idle example) 
in real world we never reach to error zero but its our goal to reach zero
goal we write in y axis
whoever impacting the goal x axis
datapoint(point of x and y)

task: step1 try to identify the problem statement and challenges(brainstorm with team)
      step2 topic knowledge in depth  req
training and testing data


dataset.shape
split data into parts   (shift tab take help )
first dump data into dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.20,random_state=42)
x.test
