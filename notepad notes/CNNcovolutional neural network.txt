CNN:covolutional neural network
deep learning
convol way feature extraction
bht se pixel ko milake ek feature bnaya
for image 2d or 3d covert data into by 1d thru flatten
image size 1000 by 1000  image ko choti krdi convol k baad output is also a image
neural network another name fully connected layers (FC)
CNN DESIGN = convol +flatten and FC
image cut in diff ways(covol) more convol more accurate but it costly as CPU consume time 
more convol better result proper extract
4 convol layer(main work feature extraction) 4 image ..har pixel x1,x2 h
we dont feed our convol image directly into FC pehle image ko chota krne k liye alg se program run krenge known as pooling layer (iss tarah chota kre image ko without loosing important information)
then 2d 3d image ko flatten se 1d krenge then load into NNor FC 
1d m isliye kia bcz we cant train our model thru 2d 3d
box ko kernel bolte h 
WE CAN generate our own images by all angles
